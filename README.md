## Overview
TiXL is an open source software to create realtime motion graphics. We are targeting the sweet spot between real-time rendering, graph-based procedural content generation and linear keyframe animation and editing. This combination allowsâ€¦ 
- artists to build audio reactive vj content
- use advanced interfaces for exploring parameters
- or to combine keyframe animation with automation

Technical artists can also dive deeper and use TiXL for advanced development of fragment or compute shaders or to add input from midi controllers and sensors or sources like OSC or Spout. 

We strongly believe in usability and intuitive and beautiful interface design. That's why we experiment with different approaches before striking the right
balance between usability and powerful flexibility. Currently TiXL version 4 is an ongoing development. It's stable enough to produce high-end visuals
create motion graphics use many industry standard features like color correction, scopes and tone mapping, and export small standalone executables.

We hope to bring together a community of artists, developers and creative tinkerers to drive the design and development of the software as a free open source project.
